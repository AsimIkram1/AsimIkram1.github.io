I am a Computer Science Graduate with 3 years of experience working with various technologies. I was recently a graduate research assistant at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri, USA where I was working on a parallel task scheduler. Previously, I was a research associate at the National Center for Cyber Forensics located at Air University, Islamabad where I was working on Mobile Device Forensics with a amazing group of people. Previously, I worked with a wonderful group of people at XFlow Research Pvt. Ltd. on projects that were based on Network Function Virtualization. I graduated with a Master's and Bachelor's degree of Computer Sciences from the National University of Computer Science, Islamabad, Pakistan in 2018 and 2015 respectively. In my free time, I enjoy video gaming and photography.
