I am a research assistant at the National Center for Cyber Forensics located at Air University, Islamabad where I work on Mobile Device Forensics with a amazing group of people. Previously, I worked with a wonderful group of people at XFlow Research Inc. on projects that were based on Network Function Virtualization.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the national University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Islamabad in 2016. In 2018, I graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus in Cloud Computing from the same university. My research interests include cybersecurity and cloud computing.

In my free time, I enjoy video gaming and photography.
